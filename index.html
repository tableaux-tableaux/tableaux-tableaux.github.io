        <!-- <p>Tableaux Tableaux is an interactive web-based application that proposes collage-making as a tool for citation.

            Tableaux Tableaux is an interactive web-based application that prompts users to engage the aesthetics of Black life through the formal framework of the pictorial tableau. The application offers an immersive digital experience that invites participants to create collages, or photo essays, from a curated collection of images.

            At the heart of this work is the history of the displacement of Black Chicagoans on the south and west sides of Chicago from 1950 to 1970. This displacement began in 1947 with legislation that enabled the city to raze areas it deemed blighted.1 The Chicago Department of Urban Renewal (CDUR) commissioned photographs to document the state of the homes and community spaces in these areas to show evidence of dilapidation so that the properties could be torn down or rehabilitated, often replaced with shopping centers, high-rise housing, and university and medical campus expansions. In the 1960s, then-mayor Richard J. Daley’s administration planned and executed the construction of housing projects that Black Chicagoans would mainly occupy, which were eventually abandoned by the city and effectively became slums. This so-called “urban planning” significantly contributed to the racial segregation that divides Chicago to this day.

            Selected photographs from the CDUR photographic archive make up an index of images that can be set as a background within the Tableaux Tableaux platform. I am also interested in highlighting the beauty of these homes that were deemed “blighted”. For example, a photograph of a living room at 6119 S. Vernon Avenue is decorated quite opulently: embellished drapes, antique carved wood furniture, and foxy lampshades. Others do show some wear and tear, but also a commitment to repair and decoration that signals a sense of ownership of the space. I have also decided to include some photographs that are not from inside of homes, but reference Black interiority or culture more broadly: a Cadillac DeVille parked outside on a residential street, two images of the inside of Greater Salem Missionary Baptist Church, and two Black women having a conversation in a shop in Harper Court (Hyde Park). Taken from their original context, these photographs now present a compelling temporal encounter, situating the user/viewer/participant/collaborator inside the homes and community spaces that are imbued with the lived experiences of their occupants.

            A second index of images is sourced from the pages of magazines produced by the Johnson Publishing Company, Inc. (JPC). Based in Chicago, JPC was the largest Black-owned public media company from the 1960s to the early 2000s. Founded in 1942 by John Harold Johnson, JPC produced several publications that centered Black life, popular culture, and achievements including Ebony, Negro Digest/Black World, Tan, Jet, and Ebony Jr. These publications were instrumental in documenting Black culture and society and played a significant role in changing how Black people are represented in mass media.
        </p>
        <p>
            JPC’s rise as the leading Black media company coincided with the Black Arts Movement of the 1960s-70s, which is also when the CDUR photographs were commissioned. This temporality is important as a period of significant political and artistic growth in the Black American community in Chicago and at large. The JPC-sourced images chronicle narratives of Black life as depicted through commercial and editorial photographs, photographic documentation of events, and advertisements found in the pages of Ebony and Jet Magazine issues from the early 70s through the 90s (with the hope of adding more images from 60s publications as I find them). Through the employment of these images, Tableaux Tableaux seeks to subvert the narratives that were being concocted by the state by recontextualizing the CDUR photographs within a constellation of images created and disseminated by and for Black people.
        </p>
        <p>
            The JPC images can be loaded onto the page and arranged, dragged, resized, and superimposed on the background and on each other, and resist being fixed by constantly being in motion. This creates slippages—some parts of the images become fugitive while others are highlighted, new textures are created, and meaning and narrative are forged through layering and juxtaposition. The images are loaded randomly via the click of a button, inviting the user/viewer/participant/collaborator to engage in and respond to chance operations to create their tableau. This activity, and specifically with the inclusion of text excerpts from the magazines, references the southern Black practice of newspapering walls, which was a practice believed to ward off evil enslaving spirits.8 The paint function allows the user to create flat areas of color or silhouettes to round out their collage, a technique employed by many collagists and notably Romare Bearden whose 1972 photo-lithographic collage Ritual Bayou references the southern Black tradition of newspapering walls.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tableaux Tableaux centers Black interiority and domestic space as sacred, creative, and resistant. The platform facilitates gestures of reclamation, reframing photographs of "blighted" spaces as sites of beauty. The resulting collages serve as not just visual compositions, but alternative records created from fragments of a violently disrupted past.
